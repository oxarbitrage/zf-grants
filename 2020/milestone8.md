# Milestone 8

```
From:           2020-08-01
To:             2020-08-31
```

## Planned work

In this milestone the main focus will remain in zebra as past milestone was productive so we want to repeat it. There is also going to be some room to do some zcashd, there are old pull requests that had been reviewed and there are new issues that i could take.

We are also repeating the mechanics of adding issues to the list as they are happening, this is mainly because zebra development is too fast to create a realistic list of issues to work on for an entire month.
