## Planned work

In the last milestone of this proposal there are 2 main goals initially. 

First, help the zebra team testing the sync for the first alpha release. Having the software running without problems up to current blockchain heights is crucial for the release and by this i am syncing and collecting information. It is still possible to submit some code for the alpha in the first week however only bug fixes are allowed. After the release it is expected to resume normal operations so issues worked on will be added to the list. 

Second goal, write a new proposal for 2021. As this one is ending but the experience was good as far as i can say, it is planned to create a new one for the next year in similar conditions.
