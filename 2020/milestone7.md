# Milestone 7

## Planned work

For this milestone the focus will be shifted from zcash c++ into zebra client. Taking apart that zebra is rust and that will require some learning curve, the 2 are implementations of the same protocol. The decision of this shift for this specific milestone was made by discussions between me, the Zcash Foundation and the zebra team.

As this milestone is the first in the subject the estimations on specific issues can be too off thus the mechanics will be a bit different than before. Instead of adding the list of tasks that will be worked on in the entire month, they will be added as they are taken.
